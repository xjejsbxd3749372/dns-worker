### Why DNS Worker?

| | Traditional DNS Services | DNS Worker |
|---|---|---|
| **Hosting** | Requires a VPS or home server | Runs on Cloudflare's free tier — no server needed |
| **Latency** | Depends on server location | Edge-computed in 300+ cities worldwide |
| **Maintenance** | Manual updates, OS patches | Zero-maintenance serverless deployment |
| **Scaling** | Limited by hardware | Scales automatically with Cloudflare's network |
| **Cost** | Server fees + electricity | Free for most personal usage |

> Deploy your own privacy-respecting DNS resolver in under 5 minutes — no credit card, no server, no DevOps.

### What is DNS over HTTPS (DoH)?

DoH (RFC 8484) is a protocol for performing DNS queries via encrypted HTTPS connections. Compared to traditional plaintext DNS, DoH can:
*   **Prevent Hijacking**: Prevents ISPs or third parties from tampering with DNS responses.
*   **Enhance Privacy**: Hides your browsing history through an encrypted tunnel.
*   **Bypass Censorship**: Provides more stable resolution in restricted network environments.

## ✨ Core Features

-   🚀 **Ultra-fast Resolution**: Fully based on edge computing with extremely low global latency.
-   🗒️ **Multi-profile Management**: Supports creating multiple independent configurations, each with a unique endpoint.
-   🛡️ **Granular Filtering**:
    -   **Allow/Block Lists**: Supports exact domain and subdomain wildcard matching.
    -   **Third-party Rule Sets**: Supports subscribing to external blocklists in formats like AdGuard.
    -   **Custom Redirection**: Supports custom overrides for A, AAAA, TXT, and CNAME records.
-   📊 **Real-time Stats & Logs**: Visual dashboard recording every request's hit reason, geo-location, and upstream latency.
-   🔐 **Privacy Enhancement**: Flexible ECS (EDNS Client Subnet) configuration (Forward, Custom, or Hidden).
-   🔒 **Rewrite ECH & ECH Fronting**: Automatically injects/rewrites ECH (Encrypted Client Hello) parameters and customizable Outer SNI (ECH Fronting) for HTTPS (Type 65) / SVCB (Type 64) queries to eliminate plaintext SNI leakage. *(Note: ECH rewriting is exclusively supported for domains proxied by Cloudflare)*.
-   🌗 **Modern UI**: Dark mode support, high-density management panel built with React + BlueprintJS.

### Resolution Pipeline
When a DNS request arrives, it goes through the following processing stages:
1.  **Memory Cache Check**: Checks if a valid response for the query exists in the edge node's memory.
2.  **Config Loading**: Layers profile settings loading from Memory -> Cache API -> D1 Database.
3.  **Local Rule Matching**:
    -   **Whitelist**: If hit, forwards directly to upstream and returns.
    -   **Redirection**: If hit, returns custom records.
    -   **Blacklist**: If hit, returns NXDOMAIN, 0.0.0.0, or a custom result.
4.  **External List Filtering**:
    -   Use a **Bloom filter** for fast filtering.
5.  **Upstream Resolution**: If none of the above hit, requests the upstream DoH server based on configuration, with optional ECS support.
6.  **Async Logging & Caching**: Asynchronously records resolution logs, fetches target GeoIP, and writes results to various cache levels.

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Online Deployment (Cloudflare Dashboard)

1.  **Fork this repo**: Click the `Fork` button at the top right to clone the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create D1 Database**: Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard, go to `Workers & Pages` > `D1`, and create a new database (e.g., named `dns_worker_db`), and copy the created database ID.
3.  **Configure Database ID**: In your forked repository, edit the `wrangler.toml` file and replace `database_id` with the ID of the database you just created.
4.  **Create Worker**: Go to Cloudflare dashboard `Workers & Pages` > `Create application`.
5.  **Import from GitHub & Complete Initial Deployment**: On the deployment page, select `Continue with GitHub`, connect your forked project, and complete the authorized deployment. Under the Build & Deploy settings, configure as follows:
    *   **Build command**: `npm run build`
    *   **Deploy command**: `npm run deploy`
    *   **Root directory (Path)**: `/`
    > ⚠️ **Note**: Environment variables entered in the initial project setup wizard are only injected into the build container and will not take effect as runtime secrets. Proceed with the "Deploy" button directly, and configure runtime secrets in your Worker's settings after the initial deployment finishes.
6.  **Configure JWT Secret**: After the initial deployment completes, go to Cloudflare Dashboard -> `Workers & Pages` -> click on your Worker -> `Settings` -> `Runtime variables and secrets` (or `Variables and secrets`) -> click `Add`. Set the Name to `JWT_SECRET`, choose type `Secret`, input a secure random string as Value, and click `Deploy` (or `Save and Deploy`).
7.  **Configure KEK for Envelope Encryption (Optional)**: In the same `Settings` > `Runtime variables and secrets` section after deployment, to enable server-side envelope encryption for sensitive credentials (such as TOTP keys and recovery keys) in D1, add a variable named `KEK_v1`, type `Secret`, and input a secure key value. When you need to rotate the KEK key, add a new secret `KEK_v(N+1)` (e.g. `KEK_v2` -> `KEK_v3`, etc.) sequentially.

### Local Development & Manual Deployment

#### Development Environment
-   **Node.js**: v18.x or later
-   **Package Manager**: npm
-   **Cloudflare Account**: Workers and D1 permissions required

#### Local Setup & Deployment Steps
1.  Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2.  Initialize D1 Database:

```bash
npm run db:setup
npm run db:migrate:dev
```

3.  Configure environment variables:
    *   Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root directory and add a secure random JWT secret (required for session token signing):
        ```env
        JWT_SECRET=your_secure_random_string_here
        ```
    *   (Optional) Enable Envelope Encryption for sensitive credentials (like TOTP secrets and recovery keys) by adding a Key Encryption Key (KEK):
        ```env
        KEK_v1=your_secure_kek_v1_key_string
        ```

4.  Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5.  Deploy manually:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Serverfull Mode Deployment (Standalone Server / VPS)

DNS Worker can run completely independent of Cloudflare Workers as a standalone service on your Linux, Windows, or macOS server. Serverfull mode provides:
* **Classic UDP DNS (Port 53)**: Standard RFC 1035 UDP DNS resolution service for routers or system DNS settings.
* **DNS over TLS / DoT (Port 853)**: RFC 7858 encrypted DNS, natively supported by Android 9+ "Private DNS", with SNI-based Profile routing (e.g. `<profile_key>.dns.example.com`).
* **Web Dashboard & DoH (Default Port 3000)**: Full-featured React management dashboard and REST API.
* **Local SQLite Database**: Automatically executes schema migrations out-of-the-box without cloud dependencies.

#### Environment Variables (Configure in `.env.serverfull`, `.env`, or system environment)

| Environment Variable | Description | Default / Example |
|---|---|---|
| `SERVERFULL_TLS_KEY_PATH` | Absolute path to TLS private key file (PEM format, alias: `SERFULL_TLS_KEY_PATH`) | `/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem` |
| `SERVERFULL_TLS_CERT_PATH` | Absolute path to TLS certificate chain file (PEM format, alias: `SERVERFULL_TLS_PUB_PATH`) | `/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem` |
| `SERVERFULL_UDP_PORT` | Classic UDP DNS listening port | `53` |
| `SERVERFULL_DOT_PORT` | DoT (TLS) listening port | `853` |
| `SERVERFULL_HTTP_PORT` | HTTP Web Dashboard & DoH listening port | `3000` |
| `SERVERFULL_HOST` | Listening host IP | `0.0.0.0` |
| `SERVERFULL_DB_PATH` | Local SQLite database file path | `./data/dns_worker.sqlite` |
| `SERVERFULL_DEFAULT_PROFILE_KEY` | Default Profile key when no SNI or profile identifier is provided | First created profile |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Session authentication token secret key | Auto-generated secure random string |

#### Quick Start

1. Configure environment variables:
The project provides an out-of-the-box configuration file `.env.serverfull` (the server automatically loads system environment variables, `.env`, or `.env.serverfull` by priority). You can directly modify `.env.serverfull`, or copy it to `.env` for customization:
```bash
# Edit .env.serverfull directly (or copy via cp .env.serverfull .env first)
nano .env.serverfull
```

2. Build frontend and start Serverfull service:
```bash
npm run start:serverfull
```

3. Register as a Linux systemd background service:
```bash
sudo npm run service-create:linux
sudo systemctl start dns-worker
sudo systemctl status dns-worker
```
This generates `/etc/systemd/system/dns-worker.service` configured with `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` privileges to bind ports 53 and 853 with automatic restart on boot.

### Online Deployment to Cloudflare Pages (⚠️ Not Recommended)

If you wish to deploy the project using Cloudflare Pages (Advanced Mode):

> [!WARNING]
> **Not Recommended**: This project is primarily a DNS resolution service, which is highly sensitive to response latency. Workers, as lightweight edge functions, are much better suited for low-latency DoH resolution tasks compared to Pages Functions. Standard Worker deployment also offers simpler routing and binding management. We strongly suggest deploying via Workers instead.

1.  **Create a D1 Database**, copy its ID, and paste it into the `database_id` field in `wrangler.toml`.
2.  In the Cloudflare Dashboard, go to `Workers & Pages` > `Create application` > `Pages` > `Connect to Git`.
3.  Select your forked repository, and configure the build settings:
    *   **Framework preset**: `None`
    *   **Build command**: `npm run build:pages`
    *   **Build output directory**: `static`
4.  After the initial deployment, go to the Pages project's **Settings** > **Functions** > **D1 database bindings**, and add a binding:
    *   **Variable name**: `DB`
    *   **D1 database**: Select your `dns_worker_db` database.
5.  Redeploy the Pages project for the bindings to take effect.
